The documentation on this project is in the subdirectory "doc".
Best is to open the file "doc/html/index.html" in a web browser.

The reason for this fork of the original Sourceforge project is to add back
in several removed archive formats that were removed in 0.95.0.
Future ideas are to add in support for .m4a and .webm files.
